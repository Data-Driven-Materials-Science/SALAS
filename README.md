# Satellite_Detection_Refinement
Supporting Github Repository for "Automated and Refined Application of Convolutional Neural Network Modeling to Metallic Powder Particle Satellite Detection" Article.

This repository contains 3 sections: "sat_helpers", "data", and "examples"
 * The "sat_helpers" folder contains helper files of methods that are commonly used. This includes visualizing results, converting formats, exporting predictions, and more. 
 * The "data" folder contains all images of Scanning Electron Microscope micrographs included in the corresponding work under the folder "SEM". All images included are PNG format and held to a constant 1024x768 resolution to enable CNN trainings. In addition, the training and validation set annotations are included. Lastly, segmentations from the final prediction model on validation images are stored here and can be used to compare with the ground truth results to verify perforance. 
 * The examples folder contains examples for code to implement new features elaborated upon in the corresponding article as well as basic ones previously created. These features include, training a model, getting predictions from a trained model, converting predictions to annotations and exporting them, comparing image segmentations to ground truth data at a pixel level, quantifying performance imporvements over time by comparing multiple models performances at the same time, as well as interpretting calculated performance data into graphs that are easier to understand.
